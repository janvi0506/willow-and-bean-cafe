                <h2>About The Willow And Bean Cafe</h2>
                <p>
                     The Willow And Bean Cafe is more than just a coffee shop ☕ — it's a cozy neighborhood haven where conversations
                      brew alongside freshly ground beans. Founded in <time datetime="2019"></time> with a vision to blend comfort with craft, our café was 
                      born out of a <strong>deep love for coffee, community, and calm corners</strong>. Nestled in the heart of the city, The Willow And Bean offers a 
                      carefully curated menu of classic brews, artisanal bites, and indulgent desserts, all served in a space designed to feel like a warm hug.
                       Whether you're meeting a friend, working on your next big idea, or simply taking a moment for yourself, our café invites you to
                        slow down and savor life — one cup at a time. We believe in sustainable sourcing, local partnerships, and fostering a space where 
                        creativity and connection thrive over coffee. </p>

                <h3>Our Story</h3>
                <p>The Willow And Bean Cafe began with a tiny idea scribbled in a well-loved notebook during a rainy monsoon afternoon in Mumbai. Our founder, a lifelong
                     coffee enthusiast, wanted to create a café that felt like a warm corner of a bookshop—where every cup has a backstory, and every guest becomes part of 
                     the narrative. What started as a dream soon became a local favorite, where regulars know each other by name and where the aroma of freshly ground beans 
                     signals the start of something comforting.</p>

                    
               <h3>Our Mission</h3>
               <p>At The Willow And Bean, our mission is to create an inclusive space where everyone—from first-time coffee sippers to lifelong
                 aficionados—feels welcome. We strive to serve not just great coffee, but meaningful moments, while supporting ethical sourcing, mindful eating 
                 and community values.</p>

                <h3>Why "The Willow And Bean"?</h3>
                <p>The name symbolizes everything we love: the willow tree represents calm, shade, and comfort—just like our cozy seating corners. The bean, of course, 
                    is a nod to our love for coffee. Together, they embody our café's spirit: peaceful, rooted, and full of warmth.</p>

                    <h3>Coffee Trivia</h3>
                    <details>
                        <summary>When did coffee first appear in India?</summary>
                        <p>Coffee was first introduced to India in the 17th century, around 1670, by a Sufi saint 
                            named Baba Budan. During his pilgrimage to Mecca, Baba Budan traveled through Yemen, 
                            where he encountered coffee and became fascinated by it. At the time, the Arab world 
                            tightly controlled coffee cultivation, allowing only roasted beans to be exported. Defying this 
                            restriction, Baba Budan smuggled seven raw coffee beans back to India by hiding them in his robe.
                             Upon returning, he planted them in the hills of Chikmagalur in present-day Karnataka. This area, now known 
                             as Baba Budangiri, became the birthplace of coffee cultivation in India and remains a significant coffee-growing region today.

                        <details>
                             <summary>How did coffee come to be associated with intellectual gatherings and revolution in 17th- and 18th-century Europe?</summary>
                       
                             <p> In cities like London and Paris, coffeehouses were called "penny universities" because for the price of a cup of coffee, people could 
                            engage in stimulating conversations about politics, philosophy, and science. These venues became hubs for Enlightenment thinking and even 
                            fomented political change — notably the French Revolution.</p>.

                        <details>
                            <summary>What role did the port of Mocha (in Yemen) play in the global spread of coffee?</summary>
                            <p> Mocha was the world's first major coffee export hub in the 15th and 16th centuries. It became so central to the coffee trade that the term 
                                "mocha" is still used today to describe coffee — though ironically, little of today's "mocha" coffee contains beans from Yemen.</p>

                        <details>
                            <summary>What is the origin of the word "coffee"?</summary>
                            <p>: The word "coffee" comes from the Arabic word "qahwa", which originally referred to wine. It evolved into the Turkish "kahve", then to 
                                Dutch "koffie", and finally became "coffee" in English.</p>
                        </details>
                       
                       <details>
                        <summary> How did the Dutch contribute to the global coffee trade in the 17th century?</summary>
                        <p>The Dutch were the first Europeans to cultivate coffee commercially outside of Arabia. They smuggled coffee plants from Yemen and began growing them
                            in Java (Indonesia). This gave rise to Java as a coffee-growing region and helped break the Arab monopoly on coffee.</p>
